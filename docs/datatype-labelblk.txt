API for label block data type (github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid/datatype/labelblk)
===============================================================================

Note: UUIDs referenced below are strings that may either be a unique prefix of a
hexadecimal UUID string (e.g., 3FA22) or a branch leaf specification that adds
a colon (":") followed by the case-dependent branch name.  In the case of a
branch leaf specification, the unique UUID prefix just identifies the repo of
the branch, and the UUID referenced is really the leaf of the branch name.
For example, if we have a DAG with root A -> B -> C where C is the current
HEAD or leaf of the "master" (default) branch, then asking for "B:master" is
the same as asking for "C".  If we add another version so A -> B -> C -> D, then
references to "B:master" now return the data from "D".

------

Denormalizations like sparse volumes are *not* performed for the "0" label, which is
considered a special label useful for designating background.  This allows users to define
sparse labeled structures in a large volume without requiring processing of entire volume.


Command-line:

$ dvid repo <UUID> new labelblk <data name> <settings...>

	Adds newly named data of the 'type name' to repo with specified UUID.

	Example (note anisotropic resolution specified instead of default 8 nm isotropic):

	$ dvid repo 3f8c new labelblk superpixels VoxelSize=3.2,3.2,40.0

    Arguments:

    UUID           Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name      Name of data to create, e.g., "superpixels"
    settings       Configuration settings in "key=value" format separated by spaces.

    Configuration Settings (case-insensitive keys)

    BlockSize      Size in pixels  (default: %s)
    VoxelSize      Resolution of voxels (default: 8.0, 8.0, 8.0)
    VoxelUnits     Resolution units (default: "nanometers")

$ dvid node <UUID> <data name> load <offset> <image glob> <settings...>

    Initializes version node to a set of XY label images described by glob of filenames.
    The DVID server must have access to the named files.  Currently, XY images are required.

    Example: 

    $ dvid node 3f8c superpixels load 0,0,100 "data/*.png" proc=noindex

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    offset        3d coordinate in the format "x,y,z".  Gives coordinate of top upper left voxel.
    image glob    Filenames of label images, preferably in quotes, e.g., "foo-xy-*.png"

    Configuration Settings (case-insensitive keys)

    Proc          "noindex": prevents creation of denormalized data to speed up obtaining sparse 
    				 volumes and size query responses using the loaded labels.

$ dvid node <UUID> <data name> composite <uint8 data name> <new rgba8 data name>

    Creates a RGBA8 image where the RGB is a hash of the labels and the A is the
    grayscale intensity.

    Example: 

    $ dvid node 3f8c bodies composite grayscale bodyview

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
	
	
    ------------------

HTTP API (Level 2 REST):

GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/help

	Returns data-specific help message.


GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/info
POST <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/info

    Retrieves or puts DVID-specific data properties for these voxels.

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/segmentation/info

    Returns JSON with configuration settings that include location in DVID space and
    min/max block indices.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of voxels data.

POST  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/resolution
  
  	Sets the resolution for the image volume. 
  
  	Extents should be in JSON in the following format:
  	[8,8,8]

POST <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/sync?<options>

    Appends data instances with which this labelblk is synced.  Expects JSON to be POSTed
    with the following format:

    { "sync": "bodies" }

	To delete syncs, pass an empty string of names with query string "replace=true":

	{ "sync": "" }

    The "sync" property should be followed by a comma-delimited list of data instances that MUST
    already exist.  Currently, syncs should be created before any annotations are pushed to
    the server.  If annotations already exist, these are currently not synced.

    The labelblk data type accepts syncs to labelvol and other labelblk data instances.  Syncs to
	labelblk instances automatically create a 2x downsampling compared to the synced labelblk,
	for use in multiscale.

    GET Query-string Options:

    replace    Set to "true" if you want passed syncs to replace and not be appended to current syncs.
			   Default operation is false.


GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/metadata

	Retrieves a JSON schema (application/vnd.dvid-nd-data+json) that describes the layout
	of bytes returned for n-d images.


GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/isotropic/<dims>/<size>/<offset>[/<format>][?queryopts]

    Retrieves either 2d images (PNG by default) or 3d binary data, depending on the dims parameter.  
    The 3d binary data response has "Content-type" set to "application/octet-stream" and is an array of 
    voxel values in ZYX order (X iterates most rapidly).

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/segmentation/isotropic/0_1/512_256/0_0_100/jpg:80

    Returns an isotropic XY slice (0th and 1st dimensions) with width (x) of 512 voxels and
    height (y) of 256 voxels with offset (0,0,100) in JPG format with quality 80.
    Additional processing is applied based on voxel resolutions to make sure the retrieved image 
    has isotropic pixels.  For example, if an XZ image is requested and the image volume has 
    X resolution 3 nm and Z resolution 40 nm, the returned image's height will be magnified 40/3
    relative to the raw data.
    The example offset assumes the "grayscale" data in version node "3f8c" is 3d.
    The "Content-type" of the HTTP response should agree with the requested format.
    For example, returned PNGs will have "Content-type" of "image/png", and returned
    nD data will be "application/octet-stream".

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    dims          The axes of data extraction in form "i_j_k,..."  Example: "0_2" can be XZ.
                    Slice strings ("xy", "xz", or "yz") are also accepted.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.
    format        Valid formats depend on the dimensionality of the request and formats
                    available in server implementation.
                  2D: "png", "jpg" (default: "png")
                    jpg allows lossy quality setting, e.g., "jpg:80"
                  nD: uses default "octet-stream".

    Query-string Options:

    roi       	  Name of roi data instance used to mask the requested data.
    compression   Allows retrieval or submission of 3d data in "lz4" and "gzip"
                    compressed format.  The 2d data will ignore this and use
                    the image-based codec.
    throttle      Only works for 3d data requests.  If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation 
    				(all API calls that can be throttled) are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API 
    				call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code is returned.


GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/raw/<dims>/<size>/<offset>[/<format>][?queryopts]

    Retrieves either 2d images (PNG by default) or 3d binary data, depending on the dims parameter.  
    The 3d binary data response has "Content-type" set to "application/octet-stream" and is an array of 
    voxel values in ZYX order (X iterates most rapidly).

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/segmentation/raw/0_1/512_256/0_0_100/jpg:80

    Returns a raw XY slice (0th and 1st dimensions) with width (x) of 512 voxels and
    height (y) of 256 voxels with offset (0,0,100) in JPG format with quality 80.
    By "raw", we mean that no additional processing is applied based on voxel
    resolutions to make sure the retrieved image has isotropic pixels.
    The example offset assumes the "grayscale" data in version node "3f8c" is 3d.
    The "Content-type" of the HTTP response should agree with the requested format.

    dims          The axes of data extraction in form "i_j_k,..."  
                    Slice strings ("xy", "xz", or "yz") are also accepted.
                    Example: "0_2" is XZ, and "0_1_2" is a 3d subvolume.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.
    format        Valid formats depend on the dimensionality of the request and formats

    Query-string Options:

    roi           Name of roi data instance used to mask the requested data.
    compression   Allows retrieval or submission of 3d data in "lz4","gzip", "google"
		            (neuroglancer compression format), "googlegzip" (google + gzip)
                    compressed format.  The 2d data will ignore this and use
                    the image-based codec.
    throttle      Only works for 3d data requests.  If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation 
    				(all API calls that can be throttled) are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API 
    				call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code is returned.


POST <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/raw/0_1_2/<size>/<offset>[?queryopts]

    Puts block-aligned voxel data using the block sizes defined for  this data instance.  
    For example, if the BlockSize = 32, offset and size must be multiples of 32.

    Example: 

    POST <api URL>/node/3f8c/segmentation/raw/0_1_2/512_256_128/0_0_32

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.

    Query-string Options:

    roi           Name of roi data instance used to mask the requested data.
    mutate        Default "false" corresponds to ingestion, i.e., the first write of the given block.
                    Use "true" to indicate the POST is a mutation of prior data, which allows any
                    synced data instance to cleanup prior denormalizations.  If "mutate=true", the
                    POST operations will be slower due to a required GET to retrieve past data.
    compression   Allows retrieval or submission of 3d data in "lz4" and "gzip"
                    compressed format.
    throttle      If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation (all API calls that can be throttled) 
                    are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) 
                    status code is returned.

GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/pseudocolor/<dims>/<size>/<offset>[?queryopts]

    Retrieves label data as pseudocolored 2D PNG color images where each label hashed to a different RGB.

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/segmentation/pseudocolor/0_1/512_256/0_0_100

    Returns an XY slice (0th and 1st dimensions) with width (x) of 512 voxels and
    height (y) of 256 voxels with offset (0,0,100) in PNG format.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    dims          The axes of data extraction.  Example: "0_2" can be XZ.
                    Slice strings ("xy", "xz", or "yz") are also accepted.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.

    Query-string Options:

    roi       	  Name of roi data instance used to mask the requested data.
    compression   Allows retrieval or submission of 3d data in "lz4" and "gzip"
                    compressed format.
    throttle      If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation (all API calls that can be throttled) 
                    are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) 
                    status code is returned.

GET <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/label/<coord>

	Returns JSON for the label at the given coordinate:
	{ "Label": 23 }
	
    Arguments:
    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of label data.
    coord     	  Coordinate of voxel with underscore as separator, e.g., 10_20_30

GET <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/labels[?queryopts]

	Returns JSON for the labels at a list of coordinates.  Expects JSON in GET body:

	[ [x0, y0, z0], [x1, y1, z1], ...]

	Returns for each POSTed coordinate the corresponding label:

	[ 23, 911, ...]
	
    Arguments:
    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of label data.

    Query-string Options:

    hash          MD5 hash of request body content in hexadecimal string format.

GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/blocks/<size>/<offset>[?queryopts]

    Retrieves blocks corresponding to the extents specified by the size and offset.  The
    subvolume request must be block aligned.  This is the most server-efficient way of
    retrieving labelblk data, where data read from the underlying storage engine
    is written directly to the HTTP connection.

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/segmentation/blocks/64_64_64/0_0_0

	If block size is 32x32x32, this call retrieves up to 8 blocks where the first potential
	block is at 0, 0, 0.  The returned byte stream has a list of blocks with a leading block 
	coordinate (3 x int32) plus int32 giving the # of bytes in this block, and  then the 
	bytes for the value.  If blocks are unset within the span, they will not appear in the stream,
	so the returned data will be equal to or less than spanX blocks worth of data.  

    The returned data format has the following format where int32 is in little endian and the bytes of
    block data have been compressed in LZ4 format.

        int32  Block 1 coordinate X (Note that this may not be starting block coordinate if it is unset.)
        int32  Block 1 coordinate Y
        int32  Block 1 coordinate Z
        int32  # bytes for first block (N1)
        byte0  Block N1 serialization using chosen compression format (see "compression" option below)
        byte1
        ...
        byteN1

        int32  Block 2 coordinate X
        int32  Block 2 coordinate Y
        int32  Block 2 coordinate Z
        int32  # bytes for second block (N2)
        byte0  Block N2 serialization using chosen compression format (see "compression" option below)
        byte1
        ...
        byteN2

        ...

    If no data is available for given block span, nothing is returned.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.

    Query-string Options:

    compression   Allows retrieval of block data in "lz4" (default) or "uncompressed".
    throttle      If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation (all API calls that can be 
                  throttled) are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API call right away, a 503 
                  (Service Unavailable) status code is returned.
