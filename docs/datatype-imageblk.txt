API for image block datatype (github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid/datatype/imageblk)
==============================================================================

Note: UUIDs referenced below are strings that may either be a unique prefix of a
hexadecimal UUID string (e.g., 3FA22) or a branch leaf specification that adds
a colon (":") followed by the case-dependent branch name.  In the case of a
branch leaf specification, the unique UUID prefix just identifies the repo of
the branch, and the UUID referenced is really the leaf of the branch name.
For example, if we have a DAG with root A -> B -> C where C is the current
HEAD or leaf of the "master" (default) branch, then asking for "B:master" is
the same as asking for "C".  If we add another version so A -> B -> C -> D, then
references to "B:master" now return the data from "D".

-----

Different data types are available:

    uint8blk
    rgba8blk

Command-line:

$ dvid repo <UUID> new imageblk <data name> <settings...>

	Adds newly named data of the 'type name' to repo with specified UUID.

	Example (note anisotropic resolution specified instead of default 8 nm isotropic):

	$ dvid repo 3f8c new uint8blk mygrayscale BlockSize=32,32,32 Res=3.2,3.2,40.0

    Arguments:

    UUID           Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    type name      Data type name, e.g., "uint8"
    data name      Name of data to create, e.g., "mygrayscale"
    settings       Configuration settings in "key=value" format separated by spaces.

    Configuration Settings (case-insensitive keys)

    BlockSize      Size in pixels  (default: %d)
    VoxelSize      Resolution of voxels (default: %f)
    VoxelUnits     Resolution units (default: "nanometers")
	Background     Integer value that signifies background in any element (default: 0)
	GridStore      Store designation that gives neuroglancer precomputed specification
	ScaleLevel     Used if GridStore set.  Specifies scale level (int) of resolution.

$ dvid node <UUID> <data name> load <offset> <image glob>

    Initializes version node to a set of XY images described by glob of filenames.  The
    DVID server must have access to the named files.  Currently, XY images are required.

    Example: 

    $ dvid node 3f8c mygrayscale load 0,0,100 data/*.png

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    offset        3d coordinate in the format "x,y,z".  Gives coordinate of top upper left voxel.
    image glob    Filenames of images, e.g., foo-xy-*.png

$ dvid node <UUID> <data name> put local  <plane> <offset> <image glob>
$ dvid node <UUID> <data name> put remote <plane> <offset> <image glob>

    Adds image data to a version node when the server can see the local files ("local")
    or when the server must be sent the files via rpc ("remote").  If possible, use the
    "load" command instead because it is much more efficient.

    Example: 

    $ dvid node 3f8c mygrayscale put local xy 0,0,100 data/*.png

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    dims          The axes of data extraction in form "i,j,k,..."  Example: "0,2" can be XZ.
                    Slice strings ("xy", "xz", or "yz") are also accepted.
    offset        3d coordinate in the format "x,y,z".  Gives coordinate of top upper left voxel.
    image glob    Filenames of images, e.g., foo-xy-*.png
	

$ dvid node <UUID> <data name> roi <new roi data name> <background values separated by comma> 

    Creates a ROI consisting of all voxel blocks that are non-background.

    Example:

    $ dvid node 3f8c mygrayscale roi grayscale_roi 0,255

    
    ------------------

HTTP API (Level 2 REST):

GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/help

	Returns data-specific help message.


GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/info

    Retrieves or DVID-specific data properties for these voxels.

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/grayscale/info

    Returns JSON with configuration settings that include location in DVID space and
    min/max block indices.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of voxels data.


GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/metadata

	Retrieves a JSON schema (application/vnd.dvid-nd-data+json) that describes the layout
	of bytes returned for n-d images.

POST  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/extents
  
  	Sets the extents for the image volume.  This is primarily used when POSTing from multiple
	DVID servers not sharing common metadata to a shared backend.
  
  	Extents should be in JSON in the following format:
  	{
  	    "MinPoint": [0,0,0],
  	    "MaxPoint": [300,400,500]
  	}

POST  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/resolution
  
  	Sets the resolution for the image volume. 
  
  	Extents should be in JSON in the following format:
  	[8,8,8]

GET <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/rawkey?x=<block x>&y=<block y>&z=<block z>

    Returns JSON describing hex-encoded binary key used to store a block of data at the given block coordinate:

    {
        "Key": "FF3801AD78BBD4829A3"
    }

    The query options for block x, y, and z must be supplied or this request will return an error.

GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/isotropic/<dims>/<size>/<offset>[/<format>][?queryopts]

    Retrieves either 2d images (PNG by default) or 3d binary data, depending on the dims parameter. 
	If the underlying data is float32, then the little-endian four byte format is written as RGBA.
    The 3d binary data response has "Content-type" set to "application/octet-stream" and is an array of 
    voxel values in ZYX order (X iterates most rapidly).

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/grayscale/isotropic/0_1/512_256/0_0_100/jpg:80

    Returns an isotropic XY slice (0th and 1st dimensions) with width (x) of 512 voxels and
    height (y) of 256 voxels with offset (0,0,100) in JPG format with quality 80.
    Additional processing is applied based on voxel resolutions to make sure the retrieved image 
    has isotropic pixels.  For example, if an XZ image is requested and the image volume has 
    X resolution 3 nm and Z resolution 40 nm, the returned image's height will be magnified 40/3
    relative to the raw data.
    The example offset assumes the "grayscale" data in version node "3f8c" is 3d.
    The "Content-type" of the HTTP response should agree with the requested format.
    For example, returned PNGs will have "Content-type" of "image/png", and returned
    nD data will be "application/octet-stream".

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    dims          The axes of data extraction in form "i_j_k,..."  Example: "0_2" can be XZ.
                    Slice strings ("xy", "xz", or "yz") are also accepted.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.
    format        Valid formats depend on the dimensionality of the request and formats
                    available in server implementation.
                  2D: "png", "jpg" (default: "png")
                    jpg allows lossy quality setting, e.g., "jpg:80"
                  nD: uses default "octet-stream".

    Query-string Options:

    throttle      Only works for 3d data requests.  If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation 
                    (all API calls that can be throttled) are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API 
                    call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code is returned.

GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/specificblocks[?queryopts]

    Retrieves blocks corresponding to those specified in the query string.  This interface
    is useful if the blocks retrieved are not consecutive or if the backend in non ordered.

    TODO: enable arbitrary compression to be specified

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/grayscale/specificblocks?blocks=x1,y1,z2,x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,z3
	
	This will fetch blocks at position (x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2), and (x3,y3,z3).
	The returned byte stream has a list of blocks with a leading block 
	coordinate (3 x int32) plus int32 giving the # of bytes in this block, and  then the 
	bytes for the value.  If blocks are unset within the span, they will not appear in the stream,
	so the returned data will be equal to or less than spanX blocks worth of data.  

    The returned data format has the following format where int32 is in little endian and the bytes of
    block data have been compressed in JPEG format.

        int32  Block 1 coordinate X (Note that this may not be starting block coordinate if it is unset.)
        int32  Block 1 coordinate Y
        int32  Block 1 coordinate Z
        int32  # bytes for first block (N1)
        byte0  Bytes of block data in jpeg-compressed format.
        byte1
        ...
        byteN1

        int32  Block 2 coordinate X
        int32  Block 2 coordinate Y
        int32  Block 2 coordinate Z
        int32  # bytes for second block (N2)
        byte0  Bytes of block data in jpeg-compressed format.
        byte1
        ...
        byteN2

        ...

    If no data is available for given block span, nothing is returned.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.

    Query-string Options:

    compression   Allows retrieval of block data in default storage or as "uncompressed".
    blocks	  x,y,z... block string
    prefetch	  ("on" or "true") Do not actually send data, non-blocking (default "off")


GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/subvolblocks/<size>/<offset>[?queryopts]

    Retrieves blocks corresponding to the extents specified by the size and offset.  The
    subvolume request must be block aligned.  This is the most server-efficient way of
    retrieving imagelblk data, where data read from the underlying storage engine
    is written directly to the HTTP connection.

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/segmentation/subvolblocks/64_64_64/0_0_0

	If block size is 32x32x32, this call retrieves up to 8 blocks where the first potential
	block is at 0, 0, 0.  The returned byte stream has a list of blocks with a leading block 
	coordinate (3 x int32) plus int32 giving the # of bytes in this block, and  then the 
	bytes for the value.  If blocks are unset within the span, they will not appear in the stream,
	so the returned data will be equal to or less than spanX blocks worth of data.  

    The returned data format has the following format where int32 is in little endian and the bytes of
    block data have been compressed in JPEG format.

        int32  Block 1 coordinate X (Note that this may not be starting block coordinate if it is unset.)
        int32  Block 1 coordinate Y
        int32  Block 1 coordinate Z
        int32  # bytes for first block (N1)
        byte0  Bytes of block data in jpeg-compressed format.
        byte1
        ...
        byteN1

        int32  Block 2 coordinate X
        int32  Block 2 coordinate Y
        int32  Block 2 coordinate Z
        int32  # bytes for second block (N2)
        byte0  Bytes of block data in jpeg-compressed format.
        byte1
        ...
        byteN2

        ...

    If no data is available for given block span, nothing is returned.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.

    Query-string Options:

	compression   Allows retrieval of block data in "jpeg" (default) or "uncompressed". 
					Note that if the data isn't stored as JPEG, it cannot be requested. 
    throttle      If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation (all API calls that can be throttled) 
                    are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) 
                    status code is returned.





GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/raw/<dims>/<size>/<offset>[/<format>][?queryopts]

    Retrieves either 2d images (PNG by default) or 3d binary data, depending on the dims parameter.
	If the underlying data is float32, then the little-endian four byte format is written as RGBA.
    The 3d binary data response has "Content-type" set to "application/octet-stream" and is an array of 
    voxel values in ZYX order (X iterates most rapidly).

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/grayscale/raw/0_1/512_256/0_0_100/jpg:80

    Returns a raw XY slice (0th and 1st dimensions) with width (x) of 512 voxels and
    height (y) of 256 voxels with offset (0,0,100) in JPG format with quality 80.
    By "raw", we mean that no additional processing is applied based on voxel
    resolutions to make sure the retrieved image has isotropic pixels.
    The example offset assumes the "grayscale" data in version node "3f8c" is 3d.
    The "Content-type" of the HTTP response should agree with the requested format.
    For example, returned PNGs will have "Content-type" of "image/png", and returned
    nD data will be "application/octet-stream". 

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    dims          The axes of data extraction in form "i_j_k,..."  
                    Slice strings ("xy", "xz", or "yz") are also accepted.
                    Example: "0_2" is XZ, and "0_1_2" is a 3d subvolume.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.
    format        Valid formats depend on the dimensionality of the request and formats
                    available in server implementation.
                  2D: "png", "jpg" (default: "png")
                    jpg allows lossy quality setting, e.g., "jpg:80"
                  3D: uses default "octet-stream".

    Query-string Options:

    roi           Name of roi data instance used to mask the requested data.
    attenuation   For attenuation n, this reduces the intensity of voxels outside ROI by 2^n.
                  Valid range is n = 1 to n = 7.  Currently only implemented for 8-bit voxels.
                  Default is to zero out voxels outside ROI.
    throttle      Only works for 3d data requests.  If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation 
                    (all API calls that can be throttled) are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API 
                    call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code is returned.

POST <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/raw/0_1_2/<size>/<offset>[?queryopts]

    Puts block-aligned voxel data using the block sizes defined for  this data instance.  
    For example, if the BlockSize = 32, offset and size must be multiples of 32.

    Example: 

    POST <api URL>/node/3f8c/grayscale/raw/0_1_2/512_256_128/0_0_32

    Throttling can be enabled by passing a "throttle=true" query string.  Throttling makes sure
    only one compute-intense operation (all API calls that can be throttled) is handled.
    If the server can't initiate the API call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) status
    code is returned.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    size          Size in voxels along each dimension specified in <dims>.
    offset        Gives coordinate of first voxel using dimensionality of data.

    Query-string Options:

    roi           Name of roi data instance used to mask the requested data.
    mutate        Default "false" corresponds to ingestion, i.e., the first write of the given block.
                    Use "true" to indicate the POST is a mutation of prior data, which allows any
                    synced data instance to cleanup prior denormalizations.  If "mutate=true", the
                    POST operations will be slower due to a required GET to retrieve past data.
    throttle      If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation 
                    (all API calls that can be throttled) are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API 
                    call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code is returned.

GET  <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/arb/<top left>/<top right>/<bottom left>/<res>[/<format>][?queryopts]

    Retrieves non-orthogonal (arbitrarily oriented planar) image data of named 3d data 
    within a version node.  Returns an image where the top left pixel corresponds to the
    real world coordinate (not in voxel space but in space defined by resolution, e.g.,
    nanometer space).  The real world coordinates are specified in  "x_y_z" format, e.g., "20.3_11.8_109.4".
    The resolution is used to determine the # pixels in the returned image.

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/grayscale/arb/100.2_90_80.7/200.2_90_80.7/100.2_190.0_80.7/10.0/jpg:80

    data name     Name of data to add.
    top left      Real world coordinate (in nanometers) of top left pixel in returned image.
    top right     Real world coordinate of top right pixel.
    bottom left   Real world coordinate of bottom left pixel.
    res           The resolution/pixel that is used to calculate the returned image size in pixels.
    format        "png", "jpg" (default: "png")  
                    jpg allows lossy quality setting, e.g., "jpg:80"

    Query-string Options:

    throttle      If "true", makes sure only N compute-intense operation 
                    (all API calls that can be throttled) are handled.  If the server can't initiate the API 
                    call right away, a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code is returned.

 GET <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/blocks/<block coord>/<spanX>
POST <api URL>/node/<UUID>/<data name>/blocks/<block coord>/<spanX>

    Retrieves or puts "spanX" blocks of uncompressed voxel data along X starting from given block coordinate.

    Example: 

    GET <api URL>/node/3f8c/grayscale/blocks/10_20_30/8

    Returns blocks where first block has given block coordinate and number
    of blocks returned along x axis is "spanX".  The data is sent in the following format:

    <block 0 byte array>
    <block 1 byte array>
    ... 
    <block N byte array>

    Each byte array iterates in X, then Y, then Z for that block.

    Arguments:

    UUID          Hexadecimal string with enough characters to uniquely identify a version node.
    data name     Name of data to add.
    block coord   The block coordinate of the first block in X_Y_Z format.  Block coordinates
                  can be derived from voxel coordinates by dividing voxel coordinates by
                  the block size for a data type.
